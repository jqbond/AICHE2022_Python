    "1. We have to recognize that our root finding algorithm is iterative. It is going to vary the values of w, x, y, and z until it converges. As in the case with optimization of multivariate functions, when we intend to vary these values iteratively, we *usually* need to pass them as the first argument to the function as a collection (a vector, array, list, tuple, etc.). That means we will pack w, x, y, and z into a single vector-like variable, just like we did with multivariate optimization.\n",
    "2. Similar to the way our root finding algorithm wants all of our unknown variables input as an array-like quantity, it wants our function to return the left-hand-side solution to each equation in an array-like set of identical size to our set of variables.\n",

    "`opt.root()` is quite flexible as it includes several root finding algorithms (`hybrid`, `levenberg-marquardt`, `kyrlov`, etc.). Method selection is easy with `opt.root()`; similar to everything we've seen with `opt.minimize()`, you can select the algorithm using the method keyword.  So if I wanted to change from the default `hybr` method to `Levenberg-Marquardt`, I would do so by adding the method keyword argument and passing the string `LM`, which specifies Levenberg-Marquardt."
