It is impossible to forecast all of the things you'll need students to know or do in Python, and trying to forecast that complexity at the frontend is overwhelming.  Throughout these exercises, I try to follow the guidance of: \n",

    "You won't get very far in programming if you don't know what scalars are and how to define them. You will also frequently encouter errors because you did something like formatted a variable as a floating point decimal instead of an integer. The content is dry, but if you don't at least introduce the idea that not everything in Python is \"a number,\" some of the errors they encounter will be very cryptic to them.  Moreover, once they understand the purpose of different types of \"numbers,\" they will expand their skill set.\n",

    "Think of these as variables that have a single value. Although your mind probably immediately jumps to a single number as an example of a scalar (which it is), scalars in Python are not necessarily numbers. In Python, there are many types (classes) of scalars that we will need to be familiar with:\n",

    "* **int** refers to an \"integer,\" which is a whole number. **Examples:** 1, 7, 452\n",
    "* **float** refers to a floating point decimal approximation of a number. Python defaults to 64-bit double-precision values  for floats. The maximum value any floating-point number in Python is about 1.8 x 10<sup>308</sup>. Anything larger than this will return as *inf*  **Examples:** 2.0, 6.75, 100.3\n",
    "* **complex** refers to a number that has an imaginary part. **Example:** 4.2 + 6i. Note that in Python, a \"j\" is used instead of an \"i\" for imaginary numbers.\n",
    "* **bool** A logical Boolean value. It is binary - either True or False. In most languages, including Python, True = 1, False = 0 or []. Python also recognizes explicit declarations of True and False\n",
    "* **str** A \"string\" of characters.  These are declared in Python using single, double, or triple quotes. For the purposes of this demonstration, they are interchangeable, but know that single, double, and triple quotes may have different applications when writing strings.  **Examples** 'Dog.', \"Cat.\", \"Doggo?\", '''Not a Doggo!''' are all strings. \n",
