    "### Function formatting for use with `scipy.integrate`\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a numerical solution of an ODE or system of ODEs in Python, we need to write a function. This will be a multivariate, vector function, very similar to what we did with `opt.root()`. It should be of the form `f(independent variable, dependent variable)`, where \"dependent variable\" is an array of all dependent or \"state\" variables in the ODE system, and it should return a vector of derivatives for each state variable with respect to the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first argument to the function should be a scalar representing the ***independent*** variable that describes your system. As far as the ODE solver is concerned, it is always a scalar. Remember that these loops work iteratively, and at any given time, there is only a single value of the independent variable that you are considering. \n",
    "2.  The second argument to the function should be an array-like structure (array, tuple, list) that contains all of the dependent variables in the system of ODEs that you are solving. For a single ODE, that argument will be a scalar. \n",
    "3. The function should return the deriviative of each depedent variable with respect to the single independent variable in a vector-like structure (array, tuple, list). If it is a single ODE, simply return a scalar.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The function must be of the form f(independent, dependent, \\*args); it can have additional arguments, but you will need to pass them using the args keyword in the `solve_ivp()` options.\n",
    "2. The span for the independent variable needs to be in the form of a 2-element array that contains the starting point and the ending point only. If you need to get a different set of (independent, dependent) value pairs out, we'll handle that later using the `t_eval` keyword argument using `solve_ivp` options. \n",
    "3. The initial value(s) for the dependent variables must be in a 1-D array like structure, even if you are only solving 1 ODE.\n",
    "4. The function should return an array-like structure containing the derivatives of each dependent variable with respect to the independent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "For this specific example, we are starting at y(0) = 10, and we are integrating from x = 0 to x = 6. Putting that into a format that works with `solve_ivp()`, we would say `y0 = [10]` and `xspan =(0, 6)`. We can then pass our function, integration span, and initial value for y to `solve_ivp()`, which will solve the differential equation numerically: `solve_ivp(D, xspan, y0)`."
