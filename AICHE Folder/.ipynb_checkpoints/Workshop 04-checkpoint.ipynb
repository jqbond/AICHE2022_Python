    "When I first picked up Python, I did so coming from Matlab.  Most of my attempts to use it started with a Google Search of \"how do I solve a system of equations in Python\" or \"How do I solve Initial Value Problems in Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of questions are probably the reason most of us want to use a programming language.  Both of those questions will tend to push you toward two Python Packages in particular: `Numpy` and `Scipy`.  Both of them are pretty awesome -- these are the tools that will replicate most of the tools you're familiar with from probably Matlab.  It is tempting to try to restrict yourself to the Numpy environment because, in Numpy, things behave very similar to matrices, rows, etc. to those in Matlab.  However, Numpy and Scipy are subspaces within the considerably more general Python language.  If you work in Python more broadly, you are likely to encounter places where others aren't containing themselves strictly to Numpy-like operations, and they work more in the base Python environment, where matrices really don't exist.  Moreover, since Numpy and Scipy routines are still Python at heart, some of their syntax may require you to know a bit about the base Python environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, when I picked up Python, I was confused by the different types of Data structures, why so many existed, how they were different, and where each could be used. My confusion eased considerably after I learned how these different data structures behave, so I think it is worth teaching `lists`, `tuples`, and `dictionaries` in additon to the `numpy arrays` that most of us will probably generally want to use for math and engineering programs."

    "## NDArrays/Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "NDarrays are **mutable**, ordered collections in which each element has a specific index. They can include any type of scalar or collection, so they are superficially similar to lists, but they have some important differences. One of the major ones, in simple terms is that you can *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on an array, whereas you cannot *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on a list. If you are familiar with Matlab, the \"array\" class in Python behaves similarly to the vectors and matrices that you're used to working with in Matlab (whereas lists, tuples, and dictionaries do not). To me, coming from a Matlab background, working with lists *feels* awkward, but working with arrays feels familiar. We probably can get away with mostly working with arrays in engineering courses; however, there are going to be certain cases where we need to deal with a lists, tuples, or dictionaries, so it is important to know how they differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the most robust array support is provided by the **numpy** package, so this is a good place to introduce an aspect of Python that differs from something like Matlab. In a commercial math software package like Matlab, more often than not, we mostly use features that are built into the language and accessible by default in the base of that language. In contrast, we frequently will need to add functionality to Python that is missing from the base. We do this by adding packages. \n",
