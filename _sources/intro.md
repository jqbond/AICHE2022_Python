# Welcome to Python in Chemical Engineering!

This site contains all of the materials covered at the 'Teaching Python in Chemical Engineering' Workshop held at the Fall 2022 AICHE Meeting in Phoenix, AZ.

Additionally included are Python Supplements that provide a more detailed presentation of:
1. Basic Topics in Python
2. Plotting in Python
3. Loops and Functions
4. Numerical Methods

The content here is still rough and in progress, but I want to give blanket credit to a few sources that I've drawn heavily from.

1. John Kitchin from Carnegie Mellon, who has lots of similar Python content for his various courses
2. Doug Yung, my colleage at SU; he helped to create these materials and was my partner in co-teaching a Python course in 2020.
3. The outstanding online information at https://docs.python.org
4. The same at https://docs.scipy.org
5. Likewise at https://numpy.org
