    "# Module 01: The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercises are intended to build familiarity and confidence with Python basics. We will start by learning about, creating, and manipulating various data types and data structures.  This module also covers basic operations with indexing and slicing using strings; these techniques will extend to lists and arrays in subsequent modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars vs. Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various Data Types and Data Structures. The first two modules demonstrate the differences between each of these and how and when we might use them. It is first important to understand the difference between a **scalar** and a **collection**. In simple terms, a *scalar* refers to a something that has one and only one value associated with it, whereas a *collection* refers to a set that contains multiple items. If you are familiar with the ideas of a \"row\", \"column\", \"vector\", \"matrix\", or \"array\" from working in a language like Matlab, these are examples of collections, each of which can be created in Python. Python also uses other types of collections called *lists*, *tuples*, *dictionaries*, and *sets*.  Generally, these types of collections are called **data structures**. We will discuss them in Notebook 02, but first we need to understand scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these as variables that have a single value. Although your mind probably immediately jumps to a single number as an example of a scalar (which it is), scalars in Python are not necessarily numbers. In Python, there are many types (classes) of scalars that we will need to be familiar with:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "* **int** refers to an \"integer,\" which is a whole number. **Examples:** 1, 7, 452\n",
    "* **float** refers to a floating point decimal approximation of a number. Python defaults to 64-bit double-precision values  for floats. The maximum value any floating-point number in Python is about 1.8 x 10<sup>308</sup>. Anything larger than this will return as *inf*  **Examples:** 2.0, 6.75, 100.3\n",
    "* **complex** refers to a number that has an imaginary part. **Example:** 4.2 + 6i. Note that in Python, a \"j\" is used instead of an \"i\" for imaginary numbers.\n",
    "* **bool** A logical Boolean value. It is binary - either True or False. In most languages, including Python, True = 1, False = 0 or []. Python also recognizes explicit declarations of True and False\n",
    "* **str** A \"string\" of characters.  These are declared in Python using single, double, or triple quotes. For the purposes of this demonstration, they are interchangeable, but know that single, double, and triple quotes may have different applications when writing strings.  **Examples** 'Dog.', \"Cat.\", \"Doggo?\", '''Not a Doggo!''' are all strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a scalar\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, one defines a scalar quantity by *binding* it's value to a variable name. This is done with a declaration using an equal sign, for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = 5 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\t\n",
    "These modules will work by providing a set of **Examples** that are embedded in Markdown cells throughout the worksheet, typically after introducing a concept. These are formatted as code blocks using Python syntax highlighting, and they are here to illustrate correct syntax. To complete the worksheet, you will need to ***type*** the relevant code blocks into the code cell that follows. Can you be lazy and copy/paste the code? Sure, but there is something about typing code that helps you get a feel for layout and how the language is written. So if you really want to master the language, *type the code*. This will give you time to really think about what you are doing and why. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assign the following values to variables A - E by entering them exactly as they are written in the following cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = 1\n",
    "B = 7.0\n",
    "C = 5.6 + 2j \n",
    "D = True \n",
    "E = \"Obviously, you're not a golfer.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we have ensured that the commands are correct as written above, so type them *exactly* as they are given and then click the Run button to execute the code. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + Enter (at least on Windows you can) to execute a cell."

There are probably an infinite number of ways that you might use a variable once it is defined, but some of the most basic would be simple calculations. Math operations (at least in the way that you are familiar with them), can be performed as expected on integers, floats, or complex numbers. If you perform a math operation on a Boolean value, it will be treated as either 0 (False) or 1 (True) for the purpose of that operation.  Math operations are not directly applicable to strings - instead, they generally will **concatenate** strings. We will cover concatenation later in the worksheet.  \n",
