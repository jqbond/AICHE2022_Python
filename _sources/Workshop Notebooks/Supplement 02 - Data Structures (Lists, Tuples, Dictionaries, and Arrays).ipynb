    "# Module 02: Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, particularly with data analysis, it is often either necessary or just ***really, really useful*** for us to work with collections of \"things\" instead of single, scalar values. You are probably familiar with this concept from your introductions to Matlab, which uses specific types of collections called arrays and matrices. Python includes support for both arrays and matrices in addition to several other types of collections that we might be less familiar with. As with scalars, each type of collection has unique properties that determine how we interact with them at the Python console and the applications they can or should be used for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of collections comprise the various **data structures** that we can use in Python. In Engineering courses, probably the ones that we will encounter most are probably **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **numpy arrays**. It is important to understand that the first three data structures given here (lists, tuples, and dictionaries) are part of base Python; however, these aren't necessarily the most convenient data structures for performing mathematical operations. In engineering courses, we're generally going to be happiest working with numpy arrays as they have a lot of the behavior we may come to expect in math programming languages based on experience with, e.g., Matlab. That said, numpy arrays are not a default data structure in Python -- numpy arrays are accessible only after we add support for them, and they are mostly used in numerical and scientific packages (e.g., numpy, scipy), which we have to specifically add to enrich the features of base Python. Almost certainly, we will sometimes need to work with other types of data strucyures, so it is important to know taht these all exist, what their different properties are, and how you would create them in Python."

    "\n",
    "Lists are a versatile type of collection. They are the main workhorse data structure in base Python, and they are frequently the default data structure if you don't explicitly format things as a numpy array (numpy arrays will be addressed later). so you'll probably have to work with them at some point. **Note:** the terminology \"base Python\" used here means that lists are \"built in\" to the Python base. To use arrays, we generally add a package (numpy), so numpy arrays are not part of \"base Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an indexed, **mutable** set of \"items\" that are ordered, i.e., each entry has a unique index. The \"items\" in a list can include any type of scalar or any type of collection and there are really few restrictions on what can be stored in a list structure. Because lists are **mutable**, we can we can change their contents after they are created. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a list\n",

    "```python\n",
    "G = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "H = ['dog','cat','bat']\n",
    "I = [[1.6, 2.7, 3.4], [4.4, 5.2, 6.8]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, G is a list of integers; H is a list of strings; and I is a list of lists, each of which is a list of floating point numbers. Notice that, when creating the multi-level list I, the top level list is defined with a pair of brackets, and each list inside of that list is also defined with a pair of brackets.  This is a universal syntax in Python for defining multi-level lists and tuples, and it extends to creating N-dimensional arrays, which we use to create matrices."

At the start, though, you are unaware of both what it can do and how to accomplish it. When you are trying to do something new, don't be afraid to search for \"How do I ___ in Python?\" You will be blown away by what the language can accomplish, but be prepared to parse online documentation, which is sometimes dense and computer science heavy - as you use the language more, you will get better at understanding the supporting documentation.\n",

This is called the *index*, and we saw a few examples of how to work with indexing throughout the past few examples.  In general though, if you want to access information stored in a list, a tuple, or an array (below), you will reference it by its index. For example, we'll create a tuple below:\n",

You store key:value pairs when you create a dictionary, and when you need to recall a specific value, you do so by passing the key associated with that value into the dictionary name.  For example, lets say you have a dictionary containing the core members of the Grateful Dead in 1977 sorted by their roles in the band.  You can create a dictionary in two ways; the first is using curly braces {}. You just add key:value pairs as a comma-separated series inside of the braces, and that gives you a dictionary.  Generally, you have flexibility as to what can be a key and what can be a value.  Usually I end up having either strings or numbers as keys and strings or numbers as values...but sometimes you may have lists, tuples, etc. as values.\n",

Generaly speaking, arrays are **mutable**, ordered collections in which each element has a specific index. They can include any type of scalar or collection, so they are superficially similar to lists, but they have some important differences.

If you are familiar with Matlab, the \"array\" class in Python behaves similarly to the vectors and matrices that you're used to working with in Matlab (whereas lists do not).

In contrast, we frequently will need to add functionality to Python that is missing from the base. We do this by adding packages. \n",

You can confirm this using `print()`, `type()`, and `len()` as usual. **Note** This is a very specific syntax that is required when creating numpy arrays. Parentheses and brackets are both non-negotiable--again `numpy.array()` takes a collection (a list or a tuple) as an argument.  You will see similarities to the `list()` and `tuple()` constructors introduces earlier in the module.\n",
