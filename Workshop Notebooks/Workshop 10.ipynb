So, if I were to give z(x,y) to an optimizer, it would vary the value of x while holding y fixed at the initial value. Instead, I have to create function that accepts an ***array*** as its first argument. That first argument should be a collection - usually a list, a numpy array, or a tuple - of variables that I want to adjust until I find the minimum value of my function.  So, instead of working with:\n",

The only other catch is that we need an initial guess for the (x,y) pair, and it should be a collection of the same size and type that we used for our function argument - in fact, our initial guess is what sets the data type for var.  So, my full optimization script would look something like this. Just so that we can make the optimizer work for it, let's start at an initial guess of [10, 50] for x and y, which we'll pass as `var0 = [10, 50]`. As we saw in past exercises, `opt.minimize()` will output a solution structure, and I can access individual elements using a dot operator."
