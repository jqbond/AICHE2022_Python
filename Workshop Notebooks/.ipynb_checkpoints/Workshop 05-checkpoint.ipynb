    "\n",
    "\"Row\" and \"Column\" vectors are a little different in Python (`numpy`). It is important to understand that rows ($1 \\times n$) and columns ($m \\times 1$) have 2 dimensions. A Row has 1 row and n columns, and a column has m rows and 1 column. Usually, we don't *actually* need a structure that has the true 2D shape of a row or a column. Unless we are doing something particular with a linear algebra operation, we probably aren't very concerned we aren't overly concerned about whether things are rows are columns, so we can typically get away with creating a 1 dimensional array. It is important to understand that, with a 1D array, there is only a length associated with it; it does not have a second dimension, so it is neither a row nor a column.  It is a 1 dimensional array--when I last worked in Matlab, there was no such thing as a 1D array, so this dimensionality was new to me in Python and thus confusing. "

If we ever need to create either a row or a column in Python, we have to remember that each of these things has a two dimensional shape associated with it.  2D arrays are created by passing a \"list-of-lists\" architecture into the array constructor.  The general idea is that each \"row\" in a 2D array is passed as a separate list into a top-level list."
