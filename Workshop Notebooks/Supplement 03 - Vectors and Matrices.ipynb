    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays are a bit different than what you're used to working with in Matlab. Unless you take special steps to define a higher dimensional structure, pretty much everything in Matlab is treated as a matrix by default in that it has 2 dimensions: rows and columns.  Even a \"scalar\" in Matlab is a 1x1 matrix.  So, if you are coming to Python from Matlab, you're probably used to a language where everything has a row and column specification. Numpy is a little different.\n",

    "    \n",
    "\"Row\" and \"Column\" vectors are a little different in Python (numpy). It is important to understand that rows ($1 \\times n$) and columns ($m \\times 1$) have 2 dimensions. A Row has 1 row and n columns, and a column has m rows and 1 column. Usually, we don't *actually* need a structure that has the true 2D shape of a row or a column. Unless we are doing something particular with a linear algebra operation, we probably aren't very concerned we aren't overly concerned about whether things are rows are columns, so we can typically get away with creating a 1 dimensional array. As with rows and columns, it is important to understand that, with a 1D array, there is only a length associated with it; it does not have a second dimension, so it is neither a row nor a column.  It is a 1 dimensional array--when I last worked in Matlab, there was no such thing as a 1D array, so this dimensionality was new to me in Python and thus confusing. \n",

    "If you want to multiply two matrices using linear algebra rules, it has special syntax.  First, you have to remember that dimensions are important when multiplying rows, columns, and matrices.  They all have to be correct. Their product returns a new matrix where each element (i,j) is the dot product of  row (i) and column (j). For this reason, the two matrices you intend to multiply must have dimensions (m x n) * (n x p), and their product returns a new matrix of dimensions (m x p).  As an illustration, a matrix can be multiplied by its transpose to return a square matrix (but the order matters):\n",
