    "One of the places that computers shine most is in automating repetitive tasks. When faced with calculations over large sets, we frequently handle them using loops. To truly appreciate the benefit of a loop, you have to think big - if you need to do one or ten iterations to get an answer, then it might be reasonable to solve your problem by hand, using a calculator, or using a spreadsheet. But when you have to perform an operation hundreds or thousands of times, then you'll want to use a programming language, and you will probably consider looping those calculations to automate iterations so that you don't have to write them out line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two types of loops: **for loops** and **while loops**. At a high level, they are similar in that they will repeat an operation in a cyclic fashion until they meet some criteria that we have specified, at which point, they terminate and exit, returning any outputs that we generated over the coures of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between the two types of loops is this: **For loops** will cyclicly perform an operation on every element in a pre-defined set. **While loops** will cyclically perform an operation until threshold criteria are met.\n",

    "As usual, the best way to get a feel for this is with some examples.  \n",

    "**An important note before we start:**  for loops and while loops are really just general tools that you can use in solving problems and processing data. Both are almost infinitely flexible in how they are used. It is important to remember this in going through the next examples. These will illustrate some examples of using loops, but they are intended to get you familiar with their architechure, syntax, logic, and execution. Do not get stuck in thinking \"This is always how I should use a for loop\" or \"I can only use a while loop in this situation.\" You really can abstract both types of loops to solve many different problems, it only requires that you think about how to adapt the basic architecture of the loop to solve the problem at hand."

Unlike the first example, though, I don't want to use either **ex** or **mod** as the iterable because I want to perform operations that use **both** of their values, i.e., I want to find the difference between each value in the two lists. One way to handle this is to use the iterable as an index to extract elements of the data sets that you are working with.  This is relatively straightforward - we just create an iterable that starts at 0 (the first index in Python), increases by 1 at every pass through the loop, and includes the same number of elements as my list, which is 8 in this case. We can do this using the `range()` function, which creates an interable from a starting integer to an ending integer.  The endpoint is excluded, and it takes steps of 1 integer unit by default. A convenient way to do this without counting large lists is to use the len() function to define the upper limit of your range.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for k in range(0, len(meas)):\n",

    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "This for loop simply prints the difference betwee model and experiment for each condition tested, but this general concept is easily abstracted and applied to much more complex problems - we'll see an example later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to think about why that range specification works.  Each list is 8 elements long, so my range function is range(0,8); range excludes the ending value, so it will iterate from 0 to 7, which are the correct 8 indices for an 8 element list in Python."

    "### Flexibility is powerful, but it can be frustrating\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to embrace the following about programming: There is not really one \"correct\" way to perform a complex operation.  Like the examples above of creating create a list of integers from 10 to -10 or square a bunch of numbers from 1 to 745. We did them with for loops, elementwise operations in numpy arrays, and list comprehensions above, but there are many possibilities.  Some are more elegant, more concise, cleaner, more human-readable, logical, faster, etc. There are usually at least half a dozen ways to do any one thing in programming, and that is OK.  Perhaps not only OK, it is one of the best things about programming. It affords you the flexibility to solve a given problem in a manner that suits that problem.  You do this with the toolkit that you have available at the moment, and that toolkit will continue to grow as you get more practice. You will get used to this, you will learn different ways to do things as you mature, you will become a better programmer, you will use the best approach available to you at the time, and then you will learn from more experienced programmers how to continue improving your codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: you may be wondering \"when should I use a for loop...when should I try to write that same idea as a list comprehension...and when should I use elementwise operations?\"  \n",

    "It's a great question, there is not really a universally correct answer.  That ambiguity can be frustrating, but it is that very same flexibility that makes Python so powerful. Embrace it, learn a bit about the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and use whichever is appropriate for your problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I would use whichever is more convenient, easier to script without turning my brain into a pretzel, and (if it matters and there is an appreciable difference) runs faster. My rule of thumb is that if the operations in a for loop are simple and I can visualize the structure of the list comprehension without much thought--say I want to square all of the elements in a list or add 12 to all of the elements in the list--it is probably going to be much cleaner, easier, and faster to use a list comprehension. If the operations in the for loop are lengthy and complex--let's say I need to solve a system of 12 nonlinear equations on each pass through the loop--it is probably best to expand the for loop line by line. It gets difficult to imagine how to pack so many complex operations into a single line of code. Even if you manage to do so just to convince yourself that you can, spare a thought for the other programmers that are going to eventually work with your code and need to interpret the logic in your one liner. Finally, if you are working with a numpy array, for any simple operations, it is almost always going to be cleaner to just use elementwise operations instead of loops or comprehensions."

    "Circling back to that comment about loops really shining when you need to repeat an operation over a large set. Here's an example that is relevant to chemistry and engineering. This example requires a bit of background in thermodynamics, but it should be at least somewhat familiar if you've taken general chemistry, finished material and energy balances, or heard of \"Hess's Law\". Even if none of those things are familar, fear not - the details and \"why\" of the calculations are less important than the fact that we will do a lot of them and automate the process using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say I am in the proces engineer in charge of a Fluidized Catalytic Cracker (FCC). An FCC unit is something everyone should at least know about - it is type of reactor used extensively in an oil refinery. Crude oil contains a lot of heavy, high molecular weight species that are not much use as fuels or chemical feedstocks. An FCC unit \"cracks\" these high molecular weight hydrocarbons to make gasoline and light alkenes (ethylene, propylene, butene, butadiene), which are far more valuable. There are hundreds, if not thousands of chemical reactions happening inside of a catalytic cracker. For the purpose of this example, let's say there are...100 different reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these 100 reactions has a unique enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$), a unique entropy change ($\\Delta S$), and a unique Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G$) associated with it. The enthalpy change, entropy change, and temperature determine the Gibbs free energy change according to the very simple equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$$\n",

The equilibrium constant is important because it allows us to determine the composition of our reacting mixture at chemical equilibrium. That seems like something that would be really important for any chemical process, so why not catalytic cracking? To do that for an FCC unit, we would need to calculate all 100 equilibrium constants - there is one unique K for each reaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds like a ton of tedious work to me. But it turns out that if we know a bit of Python, it is really easy. The worst part, by far, is finding the thermodynamic data for these reactions. We are going to take the lazy approach for finding thermodynamic data, which is to make it up completely for the purpose of solving this example. To this end, I will use a random integer generator to create a list of 100 *reasonable* enthalpy changes of reaction and 100 *reasonable* entropy changes of reaction. **Professor's note: This will never fly in your thermo or mass and energy courses, please understand that I am just doing this to demonstrate how to use a for loop to process a large data set.**\n",
