# # General Concepts

# You have to teach Python...from zero

# Students need a really good grasp of functions as more than "y = f(x)" type concepts.

# ## Introduce new concepts, methods, tools as they become relevant

# ## Lose the obsession with writing perfect code; write intuitive code first and make it perfect after you get it working

# There are dozens of ways too do anything with Python, and there are probably even several roughly equivalent "best" ways to do things in Python 

# Solve problems you already know the answer to.
